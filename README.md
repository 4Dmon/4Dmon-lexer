## Contributing
In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding
style.  Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your
code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

If you'd like to be particularly conscientious, find an
[editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) plugin for your text editor.
